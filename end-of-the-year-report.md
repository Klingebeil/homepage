# What’s this about?

<div class="slides-inline-contents mono-space">{{ paginator.toc.simple | markdownify }}</div>

As I am writing this text, I am currently still employed at the _Süddeutsche Zeitung_, a newspaper based here in Munich. I’ve been working here for over four years in the publisher innovation team. These years have been some of the most intense personal learning experiences for me, but as business priorities shift, so does the need for such a team.

I wouldn’t say we failed in what we set out to do, but I also think we could have been more successful, if we had today’s knowledge four years ago. Before the team was dissolved, I pitched a new idea and structure to the company, but again priorities have shifted.

This piece is this pitch. It’s not your usual format (think: slides, slides and a couple more slides) but instead takes the form of a speculative end-of-the-year report two years into the future. It’s a story of what I would have liked to do and where I think the business and the industry as a whole is moving and how we reacted to those trends. Inspired by a somewhat similar approach Julian Bleecker took [when describing the future of his company _Omata_][1]. This is a vision of the future, not a prediction.

Of course this means there’s a certain amount of wish-fulfillment burried in these pages. The ideas presented here are very much untested and not yet sanded down by the limitations of working inside a larger company. But I’ve tried to strike a balance between what I would have liked to do and what I think can be realistically achieved.

That said, I hope you enjoy this speculative report from 2024. It certainly has been a good year.

# Introduction

Munich, 20.12.2024

This year has been certainly a busy year.

# Overview

## The Approach

Our approach is still very much focussed on 

## Our Team

# The Projects

# Trend Research

We published a number of smaller reports and research zines on various topics such as the growing labor push-back to the 

**Creator Economy** — There has been a growing labor push-back to the platforms dominating what is called the creator economy. We tried shedding a light on the unionization of independent content workers and what these movements might mean for larger media companies. Especially with an eye towards the small number newly founded independent news cooperatives.

**Internet Futures** — The internet is still very much an evolving landscape and is becoming more and more splintered. With a look at the different anti-trust approaches around the globe and the reactions of big platforms and tech-companies we have been entering a new era of the web. (I especially want to point out _Facebook_’s decision to spin-off _WhatsApp_ as a somewhat dubious new legal entity and _Google_’s divestment from its 22 billion USD advertising network).

Further, the EU’s copyright directive has come into full effect this year, especially the consequences of article 11 and 17. With legal debates ongoing and the European black-out of  some American platforms, we expect 2025 to be a rather interesting year.

**Automation & Augmentation** — TBA

# Events

{% include img-small.html id="/end-of-the-year-report/event-01.jpeg" alt="" %}

Building upon our experience from last year we continued to grow our innovation conference here in Munich. Adding to the invitation-only guest-list we added a couple of exclusive tickets for people outside of our network, as well as some small sponsoring opportunities. And we’re happy to report the whole two days have been a complete success.

We’re still convinced that the typical consulting and Silicon Valley’s approaches to innovation fall way short inside a complex organisation and the used the time to discuss these ideas further. With about 50 attendees from five countries this event certainly grew from the 15 we hosted last year. It’s certainly tricky to scale up such an intimate gathering, but we succeeded for the most part.

The presentations were honest and clear and we are lucky to have convinced a number of smart minds to join us either in person or via video call. We’re still working on editing some of the outcomes and are looking forward to publishing a report on the event early next year.
