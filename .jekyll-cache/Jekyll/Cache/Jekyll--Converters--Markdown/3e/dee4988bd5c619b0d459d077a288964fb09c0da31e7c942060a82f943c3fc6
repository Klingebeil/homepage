<p>A couple of weeks ago, I was asked to share my experiences and opinion on the state and future of AI in the context of journalismâ€˜s business and praxis. The final report <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/polis/2019/11/18/new-powers-new-responsibilities/">â€œNew powers, new responsibilitiesâ€</a> by the London School of Economics and Political Science, the Polis think tank and Googleâ€˜s News Initiative is now public and sketches out a somewhat expected picture. Strategies, implementations, and ideas vary widely across the industry but are mostly focused on supporting the work of journalists, personalizing content and improving business efficiency.</p>
