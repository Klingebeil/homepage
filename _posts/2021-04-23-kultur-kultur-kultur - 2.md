Bunkering describes the wishful closing yourself of from reality. The idea you can separate your life from the rest of the planet. It’s escapism gone wrong.

Examples:

- VR (and AR to a lesser degree)
- Seasteading
- Mars
- Literal doomsday bunkers
- Fully automated luxury bunker tech (ghost kitchens, self-driving cars, „frictionless“, tech’s anti-politics)

Quotes:

> I wrote for Chanel about the illusion of the bunker : artificially maintained by wealth, power, and refusing to acknowledge that it s impossible to separate entirely from the world

-\> Thibaut

> utopia is actually close to the idealization of a closed system a self-sustaining physical environment demarcated from its surroundings by a boundary that does not allow for the transfer of matter and energy
