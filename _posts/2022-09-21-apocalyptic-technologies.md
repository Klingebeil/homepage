What do Mars colonies, the cybertruck, fallout shelters and the Metaverse have in common? They are all apocalyptic technologies. Let me explain briefly.

An apocalyptic technology derives its raison d'être directly from a supposedly approaching apocalypse. The most obvious example is the fallout shelter, whose sole purpose is to survive a nuclear strike.
The cyber truck? How else to categorize a steel vehicle with bulletproof windows if not as a rolling bunker?

The same goes for Mars colonies, [which Elon Musk explicitly calls a "backup"](https://www.space.com/40641-does-humanity-need-backup-earth.html) for humanity in case of planetary catastrophe. Structures that would have to be build as literal bunkers due to the amount of radiation on Mars.

Climate bunkers, a popular hobby for a certain kind of tech billionaire, are just another variation — [as Douglas Rushkoff writes in the Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2022/sep/04/super-rich-prepper-bunkers-apocalypse-survival-richest-rushkoff):

> Their extreme wealth and privilege served only to make them obsessed with insulating themselves from the very real and present danger of climate change, rising sea levels, mass migrations, global pandemics, nativist panic and resource depletion.

And this brings us to the metaverse, or the original Gibsonian vision of the metaverse as a digital reality [in which people can escape from the dreary present](https://twitter.com/bcmerchant/status/1418276525112107009?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1418276525112107009%7Ctwgr%5E9a49d9d1e10be2c1d925d0945f905f4e0da6fe95%7Ctwcon%5Es1). The metaverse in science fiction is a kind of virtual bunker in the tens that it tries to lock out the reality to create a controllable space and I suspect its real incarnation will be sold explicitly as such. As a space where people can "flourish" and access a "better life" than in reality.

The irony behind all these escape plans is that they cannot work without an intact societal and economic system. A cyber truck needs not only electricity, but also access to mobile communications. A Mars colony would be dependent on supply flights for a long time, bunkers need food, fresh water and medicine, and the Metaverse needs someone to maintain servers, submarine cables and code.

Should society collapse who will keep your private security guards from abandoning their rich patron? A question that, according to Rushkoff, is keeping some awake at night:

> The billionaires considered using special combination locks on the food supply that only they knew. Or making guards wear disciplinary collars of some kind in return for their survival. Or maybe building robots to serve as guards and workers – if that technology could be developed “in time”.

There is no escape through technology just varying degrees of naive escapism.
