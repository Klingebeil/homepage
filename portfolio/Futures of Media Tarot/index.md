# Futures of Media Tarot
Journalism as a industry has been through a couple of minor and major disruptions in the last two decades. The media experienced a seismic advertising shift and found itself on the shrinking end of the ad budgets. At the same time we can observe how truth as a concept became evermore vague and muddied through the internet and social media. As such parts of the industry at times seems to cultivate their own doom and gloom or romanticizes the past. Thereâ€˜s a lack of alternative futures to discuss and build towards.

Which is why we (the Medialab Bayern, my co-author Christian Simon and myself) decided to try to develop a tool we could use to influence the discussion. Inspired by the speculative design studio Superflux we adapted the TKTKT and got to work.

The finished Futures of Media Tarot now serves as a workshop tool to open up imaginative horizons, inform players about the big trends currently influencing the industry and challenge their ideas about the futures of journalism.
The game was a prominent part of the TKTK 2019 in Munich and was also played at the TKTKT 2019 in Hamburg, as well as smaller workshops.
You can find a longer write-up on Medium as well as a printable set of cards in german.
