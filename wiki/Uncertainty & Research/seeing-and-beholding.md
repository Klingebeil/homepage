title: Move from seeing to beholding
---

> *Move from seeing to beholding*: To see a situation is to catch the facts of the matter. To behold it is to witness the story. If you dwell entirely with statistics and data, you will be a burnt match within months. 
> 
> **Move from just seeing the world to beholding the world. Seeing is assessment and analysis; beholding is wonder and curiosity. It’s not that we don’t need the former, but when we crank it up excessively, we always damage the latter. Make space for the miraculous, make space for grace—these energies show up constantly in our lives.**

> To behold them is to bear witness to them. 
> 
> To celebrate them. That’s an infectious and noble position to take. 
> 
> **Difficult situations require sustained beholding. They are not necessarily to be dissected or defeated but sat with.** Could there be a third way that arises from fidelity of attention?[^1]
