# Minimal Supportable Product—A Concept

A _minimal viable product (MVP)_ is a version of a product, project, or concept with just enough features to satisfy early customers. It‘s a way of testing and iterating, popularized by the author and consultant Eric Ries.

But for innovation inside a complex organization, I found the framework lacking. As with most concepts out of the startup-to-consultancy-pipeline, it lacks a way of interfacing with the structure of the organization and its _dark matter_.

The implementation or embedding or projects in the wider company is of vital importance, especially if the goal is some kind of transformation. This is why I‘ve been thinking about how the idea of an MVP could be expanded.

My suggestion would be something like a _minimal supportable project_ or (_MSP_). An MVP that is embedded from the start in the organization and can not only be iterated along with the user‘s need but also the organization‘s capabilities, while also transforming both.
