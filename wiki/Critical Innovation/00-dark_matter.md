# Dark Matter
One of the most influential metaphors for my work is Dan Hill‘s „Dark Matter“ from his book „Dark Matter and Trojan Horses“.
_Dark Matter_ describes the invisible forces influencing organizations, projects and concepts:

> organisational culture, policy environments, market mechanisms, legislation, finance models and other incentives, governance structures, tradition and habits, local culture and national identity, the habitats, situations and events that decisions are produced within.

To work successfully as a in-house innovation team means being able to read and understand this _Dark Matter_ and also having the tools to engage with it.
