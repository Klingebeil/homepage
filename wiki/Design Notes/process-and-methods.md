## On Process

First, I‘d like to seperate “process” and “praxis”. While people tend to talk about “their process” as their way of approaching a design challenge, I‘d argue “praxis” tends to better capture the full breath better than “process”. The individual design praxis is hard to pack into neat little labeled rectangles, connected with arrows.

“Process” for me is exactly this attempt. Making praxis readble and more managable. Most processes I‘ve seen are quite literally managment-level views on the creation of design artifacts. They‘re linear with distinct steps and often methods prescribed throughout.

The most common one is the “double diamond”, as first described and later updated by the *British design council* in 2005 and 2018.

## On Methods

The [originial criticism](https://www.moderniststudio.com/corporate-education/enough-design-methods/) by Jon Kolko is now unfortunately offline but still reachable via [the wayback machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20200801000000*/https://www.themoderniststudio.com/2018/05/28/enough-design-methods/). (I also would extend this criticism to “innovation methods”)

> These are the problems with design methods: 
> 
> 1. Methods are watered down instruction, offering only the thinnest description of how design works. It’s not as easy as 1-2-3. It’s a profession, and it’s hard. 
> 2. Methods imply that experience doesn’t matter, and that anyone with a card can be a designer. Everyone should be able to benefit from the value of design. It should be a liberal art, one respected and taught with the same broad popularity as literature or philosophy. But as it’s an arduous process to become a competent writer, so too is it arduous to become “good” at design. Experience trumps method every single time. 
> 3. Methods are overly prescriptive. While some come with warning labels, most indicate that “design should be done like this” and students of the methods are taught that there is a right and wrong way to go about solving problems. I see this when I teach both graduate students and professionals. They are constantly looking for the right ways to do things, often asking questions as rudimentary as “what size post it note should we use?” – as if there’s an optimal way to design, and I have that answer and need to give it to them. 
> 4. And most importantly, methods make design seem scientific, when it is experimental. Design is not just a directed, purposeful activity. It is also reflexive, as is much creativity. We lose ourselves in the work, and the work talks back, and out of the creative process emerges magic. This is not a science of the artificial. It is an exploration of the artificial.

Maybe the best way of understanding methods is to take a page out of Georg Box‘ book: “All methods are wrong but some are usefull”. Thus be weary of people selling you the single best method to do something.
