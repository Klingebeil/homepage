## Books

***Expressive Design Systems*** (2019) von Yesenia Perez-Cruz, *A Book Apart* [[Link](https://abookapart.com/products/expressive-design-systems)]

- Absolutely excellent book when it comes to the implementation, structuring and stewarding of a design system.

## Articles
**[Creating Etsy’s Design Principles](https://medium.com/etsy-design/creating-etsys-design-principles-4faf31914be3)**
- Helpful example of what *design principles* might look like and how to write them (it involves a lot of back and forth with stakeholders)

**[Tips For Managing Design Systems](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/05/tips-managing-design-systems/)**
- A couple of rather basic but important tipps for implementing and stewarding a design system.

**[Picking Parts, Products & People](https://medium.com/eightshapes-llc/picking-parts-products-people-a06721e81742)**
- This is a neat little team exercise for figuring out which parts your new design system actually needs
