# Notes on building a design system

These are a couple of notes about building and managing a design system at the *Media Lab Bayern*.

## Context setting

**2022-12-05**{: .label .color-green} We kicked-off this project in December 2022. At this point the Media Lab has existed for almost a decade and grew from two people to ~25 at two seperate locations.

During this time, the CI also grew but was never formalized beyond a collection of graphic elements, fonts and powerpoint slides.

As a consequence the consistency and quality of the design output varied wildly. While every colleague produces design work in varying quantity, the Lab never employed a dedicated designer. Most high-quality work is done by a lead-agency which also created the CI in the first place.

What we‘re trying to do is to grow the existing CI and build a small design system. Meaning, we‘re not trying to define every use-case in a fixed document and then police the team but to create tools they can adopt creatively for their needs. Additionally we want to implement a stewardship process that enables us to periodically check in with the system to optimize, correct or discard elements.

At this point we have a cautious “go!” from the team leads and already did some preliminary research  and alignment work (a.k.a. talking to people).

The next steps:

* Create a design inventory (and overview over the complete output of the team)
* Let the team give feedback on this inventory (What works well? Where do we need more guidelines? What can be ignored at the moment?)

Both of these steps will hopefully help us define a roadmap for the next months and give us some clarity as to where the biggest problems lie.
