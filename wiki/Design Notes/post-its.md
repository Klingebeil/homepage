> Someone will write the word 'data'on a post-it note and days later that note sits there, without context and becomes meaningless. It lets us off the hook from ever having to think through ideas and concepts in detail. They're a lazy illusion of thinking. Instead we have whiteboards in the studio so we can stand together as a team and use written and visual forms.
> 
> They become constellations of words, illustrations, code, images of interfaces. You can amend them and it slows you down to properly communicate with someone. There's an immediate need to do something with those ideas as the whiteboard feels more temporary. Post-its tempts you believe they work well as repository for thinking. So people delude themselves into thinking you'll come back to a collection of Post-its.
> 
> They also create an artificial barrier between the facilitator or designer and the impact you can have by doing work. Services are not made of post-it notes, they're made of data, interfaces and people. It also gives designers the illusion of control over a process of brainstorm but again, that's not action. That's not what a designer is capable of. There are other processes we can take, other ways to do things.
