# Innovation & Language
## Innovation speak

A critique of the often misleading and over-optimistic language surrounding “innovation” by Lee Vinsel and Andrew Russel[^1].

> Innovation-speak is fundamentally dishonest. While it is often cast in terms of optimism, talking of opportunity and creativity and a boundless future, it is in fact the rhetoric of fear. It plays on our worry that we will be left behind: Our nation will not be able to compete in the global economy; our businesses will be disrupted; our children will fail to find good jobs because they don't know how to code. Andy Grove, the founder of Intel, made this feeling explicit in the title of his 1996 book *Only the Paranoid Survive*. Innovation-speak is a dialect of perpetual worry.
