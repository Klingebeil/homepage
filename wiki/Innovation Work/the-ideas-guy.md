# The ideas guy
The ideas guy is a common phenomenon in corporate settings (or LinkedIn):

> Somebody who can come up with endless lists of ideas, some good and some bad, but lacks the skills and / or motivation to execute any of them.[^1]

And yes, he‘s almost always a guy.

His prevalence might be due to the myth of the idea as a key to innovation, a precious resource to be generated and managed. Spoiler alert: ideas are cheap and useless.

Way more valuable are a) a shared understanding of a problem and b) the ability and power(!) to implement a solution.

The ideas guy tends to lack both.
