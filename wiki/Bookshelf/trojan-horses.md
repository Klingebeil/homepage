If there‘s any book I would have wished to find on my desk when I first started out working in the innovation team at the _Süddeutsche Zeitung_ it would have been this. 

“Dark Matter and Trojan Horses” is a long essay trying to define a literal vocabulary for enacting and stewarding change inside complex organizations. Hill‘s examples are for the most part the results of his work at the _[Helsinki Design Lab][1]_ and it‘s work at the outskirts of public policy, city planning and the nordic model.

It‘s not always an easy or straightforward read, so don‘t expect a how-to type of lists of methods and things you should do. Change is complicated, especially if you want to mindful of it. This book is a good start at understanding why things might fail and how to cope with them. It‘s theory based on praxis and experience.

### What I took away from it

1. His notion of „Dark Matter“ as a force connecting and influencing groups of people and especially companies. It‘s a bit fuzzy, but useful once you grasped it fully.
2. His critique of design thinking, which is the first long critique I read on the method. I never felt at home with working with design thinking but he boils it down nicely. (Don‘t expect a five star dinner from amateur cooks.)
