Erika Hall’s book is the one stop guide to everything research. It’s one of these rare books that have been edited right down to the core. Not a sentence to much, not a filler chapter in sight.

It leads you through a number of methods from framing your research to actually going out and doing it. My favorite part (and the one that helped me the most) are her notes on research *in* organizations.
