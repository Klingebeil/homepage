There are many books out there selling you all the different flavors of innovation and how you might achieve them. What‘s often missing is a critical look at what exactly is being sold as “innovative”. This book is one of those critical dissections of the praxis of enacting innovation.

From how to build an office to how to communicate with stakeholders — this one is steeped in theory and interviews while also giving you some actionable advice. If I‘d find myself in a position of having to build an innovation team from scratch, opening up this book again might be the first thing on my to-do list.
