There are a lot books out there, extolling all the different flavors of _innovation_ and how you might achieve them to you and your boss. What‘s often missing is a critical look at what exactly is being sold as “innovative”. This book is one of those critical dissections of what exactly the praxis of enacting innovation looks like.

Deschamps-Sonsino is not only wading through heeps of actual theory but also includes interview on topics ranging from how to build an office to how to communicate with stakeholders  — there‘s a lot of practical advice in here. There‘s also a lot of low-level roasting of the exuberance related to everything that looks like “innovation”.

If I‘d find myself in a position of having to build an innovation team from scratch, opening up this book again might be the first thing on my to-do list.
