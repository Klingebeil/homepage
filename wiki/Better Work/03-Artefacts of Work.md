# Artefacts of Work

One interesting notion in the last years was the question of how I can make the process of my work more engaging and transparent? An obvious direction is the idea of artefacts — the byproduct of the greater endeavormwhich can be used to present and narrate a project. The help document the process by making decisions legible.

And they‘re often too readily discarded. As Matt Webb [rightly notes][1] there‘s a hidden opportunity here, especially in the context of innovation work:

> The idea is to follow early product innovation processes, **but ship all the collateral around the product rather than the product itself**.

Such artefacts can take on a lot of different forms. They can be reports, design drafts, wireframes, photographies, mock-ups, prototypes, or actual *artefacts* from field research, etc.


<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Design artifacts are not the deliverable. They just document the design decisions, and design decisions must be rooted in user research.<br><br>If you can&#39;t draw a direct line from the artifact to how the decisions it documents will be informed, you won&#39;t produce anything of value.</p>&mdash; Pavel \#StopAsianHate (@PavelASamsonov) <a href="https://twitter.com/PavelASamsonov/status/1379864423788122113?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 7, 2021</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

As such artefacts tend to increase in fidelity and detail throughout a project. Early artefacts may be a simple post-it or rough sketch, while later projects might include visually complex explorations, concepts and testable prototypes.

What combines them is their ability of making decisions legible.

## Anchoring Artefacts
One way of extending this idea is the act of crafting “Anchoring Artefacts”, as described in [_HDL‘s_ “Legible Practices“][3], (pg. 93).

> **Tangible artefacts—documents, objects and other material—subtly embody or express the values of an organisation.** Especially when an organisation is growing rapidly or attempting to transform itself, high-res artefacts help embody organisational or operational change which is often more abstract and invisible.

One intriguing class of artefacts might be the [“one pager“][4]. A concise presentation technique for communicating the interactions within systems (i.e. in game design).

## Making things stick
A more familiar example might also be _NASA_ mission patches—easily replicated in [the form of stickers][5] or [posters][6] as used by the UK‘s _[Government Digital Service][7]_.

> Stickers like that become tokens that represent something more – a shared experience, a shared set of memories that only people who worked on that project will remember and understand. **A sticker, like a web page, can be a conscious act of institutional memory.**

_Facebook‘s_ “[Analog Research Lab][8]” operates on a similar level. Around 2010 two marketing manager set up a small print-shop on the company campus. A project, which inadvertently played an integral part in not only creating a common company culture, but also propagated it to offices world-wide.

> “It‘s more observations across the company,” says Boms, who calls himself a workplace philosopher. “The hope is that the artwork is more empathetic, curious and diverse, and it looks at what‘s happening from a critical eye. It‘s the pulse of what‘s going on internally.”  
> 
> Boms says the posters don‘t aim to dictate what employees should think.  **Rather, they offer a prompt for people to think about.**

Another quirky example is the work of [Craig Mod][2] who seems to use every opportunity to turn projects into a book. Be that via SMS during long walks through Japan or by laying out every commit ever made on a software project. Here he is talking about both.
