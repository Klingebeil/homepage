# Artefacts of Work

One interesting notion in the last years was the question of how I can make the process of my work more engaging and transparent? An obvious direction is the idea of artifacts, i.e. books or zines that are a byproduct of the greater endeavor and can be used to present and narrate a project.

One great example is the work of [Craig Mod][1] who seems to use every opportunity to turn projects into a book. Be that via SMS during long walks through Japan or by laying out every commit ever made on a software project. Here he is talking about both.

One way of extending this idea is the act of crafting „Anchoring Artefacts“, as described in [_HDL‘s_ „Legible Practices“][2], (pg. 93).

> Tangible artefacts—documents, objects and other material—subtly embody or express the values of an organisation. Especially when an organisation is growing rapidly or attempting to transform itself, high-res artefacts help embody organisational or operational change which is often more abstract and invisible.

A more familiar example might also be _NASA_ mission patches—easily replicated in [the form of stickers][3] or [posters][4] as used by the UK‘s _[Government Digital Service][5]_.

> Stickers like that become tokens that represent something more – a shared experience, a shared set of memories that only people who worked on that project will remember and understand. A sticker, like a web page, can be a conscious act of institutional memory.

_Facebook‘s_ „[Analog Research Lab][7]“ operates on a similar level. Around 2010 two marketing manager set up a small print-shop on the company campus. A project, which inadvertently played an integral part in not only creating a common company culture, but also propagated it to offices world-wide.

> “It’s more observations across the company,” says Boms, who calls himself a workplace philosopher. “The hope is that the artwork is more empathetic, curious and diverse, and it looks at what’s happening from a critical eye. It’s the pulse of what’s going on internally.”  
> 
> Boms says the posters don’t aim to dictate what employees should think.  Rather, they offer a prompt for people to think about.
