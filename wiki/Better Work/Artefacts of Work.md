# Artefacts of Work

One interesting notion in the last years was the question of how I can make the process of work more engaging and transparent. An obvious direction is the idea of artifacts, i.e. books or zines that are a by-product of the greater endeavor.

One great example is the work of Craig Mod who seems to use every opportunity to turn projects into a book. Be that via sms during long walking tours or laying our every commit ever made on a software project. Here he is talking about both.

_Folch_, a studio based in Barcelona, also walks a similar path and has an entire online shop dedicated to artifacts, magazines and books. ([Link][2])
