# Living Docs
I‘ve been a big fan of the London-based agency [_comuzi_][1] for some time. One approach I copied from the team is the idea of a „living deck“ or „living doc“.

In short: a Google Doc, that‘s used as a project documentation + project narration tool. It can be used to, quote:

- link to documents (spreadsheets, digital boards, other decks…)
- share interesting references
- document chats, ideas, crits, workshops…
- that “we should be keeping a list of these ideas somewhere” moment

María Izquierdo Alfaro wrote a longer article [all around living docs on medium][2].

Another example is the „dashboard“ Bryan Boyer [used to remotely organize][3] his „civic futures“ course at University of Michigan Taubman College of Architecture and Urban Planning during.
