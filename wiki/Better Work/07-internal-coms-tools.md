# Modern Internal Communication Tools

A couple of notes on internal communication tools and practices for organizations which are either distributed, or working in a hybrid model, or are in need of structured ways of sharing information.


### The problem with hybrid or distributed work

One problem of distributed/remote/hybrid work is the missing bandwidth of face-to-face communication or as a study of [60,000 Microsoft employees found][1]

> Our results show that firm-wide remote work caused the collaboration network of workers to become more static and siloed, with fewer bridges between disparate parts. Furthermore, there was a decrease in synchronous communication and an increase in asynchronous communication. Together, these effects may make it harder for employees to acquire and share new information across the network.

A 2020 study by *Atlassian* aptly titled „[Reworking Work][2]“ arrived at similar conclusions.

- Meetings in a distributed environment became more formalized and structured. **Unstructured, free-floating communication almost vanished completely** and with it the exchange of topics, information and ideas not tied the work at hand.
- The collaboration in teams actually got better up thanks to this formalized approach but suffered across team or department borders.
- **Individual workers fear their work might become invisible** and thus their careers may suffer without the ability to show off projects or network with higher-ups and peers. (This problem ist especially pronounced for new higher of young workers.) 

### The curious case of Automattic

*Automattic*, the company behind Wordpress is an interesting case study. It employs 1.700 people across multiple continents and time-zones sind 2005 and [has an interesting work culture][3].

1. **Asynchronous** — there are no meetings or powerpoint presentation. Everything happens via *written* communication.
2. **Transparency** — This written communication is (with exceptions) open for every employee to read, comment and share internally.

To accomplish this the company uses a [custom version of Wordpress called P2][4] as an internal forum/intranet/task-managment/documentation-tool.

- In conclusion: if a company wants to work as a distributed/hybrid organization in the long run, it might have to rethink its communication infrastructure and adopt one that is:
	- open for every employee contribute to
	- transparent
	- and most importantly: **written**

### Why is Microsoft moving in the opposite direction?

Microsoft has dominated offices around the globe with its software, lately bolstered through „Microsoft Teams“ a chat/video-call tool build for communication inside teams and organization. But its features and internal logic is not build to ideally support a written communication culture.

- subgroups (also called „teams“) are often slow to navigate.
- content can not be easily shared across such groups. (Thus they tend to create and reinforce silos within an organization)
- these subgroups are often hard to find without either an invitation or a detailed name since they often exist to represent either actual teams, project or open forums without distinction.
- users are often highly restricted in their use of teams by their managers. (For example: if they‘re not allowed to edit their own title or which part of the organization they belong to, the company as a whole become unreadable and impossible to navigate after some time)

And of course:

- The editor of Teams is not build for longer written texts. In fact it‘s pretty bare bones without features such as tagging, drafts or pre-planned publishing of content.

Microsoft has lately also been more focussed not on solving these issues but instead working on the video components of the software and even integrating its version of the „Metaverse“ (formerly called „3D“ or „VR“) in the form of virtual spaces.

(Honestly, Microsoft... just force people to add agendas to their meetings. It would make a bigger difference than starring at the feet-less avatars of my colleagues.)
