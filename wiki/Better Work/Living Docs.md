# Living Docs
I‘ve been a big fan of the London-based agency _comuzi_ for some time. One approach I copied from the team is the idea of a „living deck“ or „living doc“.
In short: a Google Doc, that‘s used as a project documentation + project narration tool. It can be used to:
- link to documents (spreadsheets, digital boards, other decks…)
- share interesting references
- document chats, ideas, crits, workshops…
- that “we should be keeping a list of these ideas somewhere” moment
