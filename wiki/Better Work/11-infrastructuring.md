Lately I‘ve been doing a lot of reading on the concept of infrastructure or to be more precise the connections between infrastructures and work.

I quite like this definition of infrastructure by Susan Leigh Star[^1]:

> - *Embeddedness*. Infrastructure is sunk into and inside of other structures, social arrangements, and technologies.
> - *Transparency*. Infrastructure is transparent to use, in the sense that it does not have to be reinvented each time or assembled for each task, but invisibly supports those tasks.
> - *Reach or scope*. This may be either spatial or temporal—infrastructure has reach beyond a single event or one-site practice.
> - *Learned as part of membership*. The taken-for-grantedness of artifacts and organizational arrangements is a sine qua non of membership in a community of practice . Strangers and outsiders encounter infrastructure as a target object to be learned about.
> - *Links with conventions of practice*. Infrastructure both shapes and is shaped by the conventions of a community of practice (e.g., the ways that cycles of day-night work are affected by and affect electrical power rates and needs).
> - *Embodiment of standards*. Modified by scope and often by conflicting conventions, infrastructure takes on transparency by plugging into other infrastructures and tools in a standardized fashion.
> - *Built on an installed base*. Infrastructure does not grow de novo; it wrestles with the inertia of the installed base and inherits strengths and limitations from that base.
> - *Becomes visible upon breakdown*. The normally invisible quality of working infrastructure becomes visible when it breaks: the server is down, the bridge washes out, there is a power blackout.
> - *Is fixed in modular increments, not all at once or globally*. Because infrastructure is big, layered, and complex, and because it means different things locally, it is never changed from above.
