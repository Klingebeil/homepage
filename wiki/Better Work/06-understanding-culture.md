title: Understanding Newsroom vs. Publisher Culture

A couple of loose notes on the cultural gaps of publishers vs. newsrooms vs. innovation teams.

## Failure to Launch: Competing Institutional Logics, Intrapreneurship, and the Case of Chatbots

[This paper by Valerie Belair-Gagnon, Seth C. Lewis and Colin Agur][1] hits some interesting beats when examining the work of innovation teams inside publishers in the case of chatbots.

The failures of chatbots as a „technology“ aside, the authors make some interesting observations:

- Journalists, intrapreneurs and managers are all governed by their own „institutional logic“, referring to the ways, rules and norms people observe and follow when operating in a given social environment. (i.e. newsrooms, innovation teams & publishers)

> Institutional logics are socially constructed from historical patterns of material practices, assumptions, values, beliefs, and rules. These logics provide meaning for the production and reproduction of action and social reality across time and space
>
> (…)
>
> A core assumption of institutional logics is embedded agency, referring to the ways that interests, identity, values, and agents’ assumptions are embedded in prevailing institutional orientations. Decisions and outcomes thus are the result of the interplay between agency and institutional structure, which both enable and constrain individual and organizational actors 
>
> (…)
>
>  The embedded agency of actors suggests that individual and institutional agents seeking to trigger technological change and innovation are not neutral but are shaped by competing logics of inter-institutional systems.

- Innovation teams are forced to manoeuvre these logics and while being propelled by their own logic („experimentation, audience orientation, and efficiency“)
- When viewed through this lens technologies individuals can develop different interpretations of a given technology. For example, innovation teams tend to be enthusiastic early adopters because they are embedded in an institutional logic of experimentation, while a journalist working in a newsroom may come to a completely different conclusion because he is focused on the quality of his work and thus might not be as keen to wildly experiment.

> Aware of existing journalistic norms and practices, though many were not trained in professional journalism, the intrapreneurs reflected on how newsbots failed. Too often they were not in sync with traditional news formats (which made it difficult for reporters follow up on stories and develop sustained conversations using newsbots) or with news delivery (which relegated newsbots to the status of ‘add-ons’ rather than vital tools that could enhance efforts to target or broaden audiences in a more consistent and concerted fashion). Therefore, newsbots did not match traditional news styles or means of distribution, nor were they adequately timed to match those moments of the day when newsbot users might be more likely to engage in a back-and-forth dialog with the technology.

- To sum up: there is a broad cultural gap between innovation teams and newsrooms and the management above both. This gap can lead to miscalculations and misunderstandings from both sides which in turn can doom certain projects.
- Innovation teams need to be aware of this cultural gap and need to do their homework and be more willing to throw away an idea if it does not fit. It‘s once again the gap between a „good idea“ and a „successful idea“.


## Competing worldview: User vs. Human

- One more good illustration of this gap [comes from the designer Ted Hunt][2] in his broader critique of „user centered design“.

- In the case of newsrooms/publishers the way journalists, managers and entrepreneurs view their audience can also be broken down along similar lines as they use similar abstractions. What‘s the difference between a _user_ and a _reader_? What're the differences between _users_  and _readership_? How are those groups broken down and why? What logic permeates the engagement with these segments?
- It‘s not about finding the _right_ way of understanding your audience, but understanding the gap of understanding. The ways these abstractions shape the work and processes of different teams.

- I found a second illustration inside the ["Urban Technology" newsletter by Bryan Boyer][3], contrasting the somewhat exaggerated worldview of an urbanist vs. „technologist“.

- How might a similar graphic look like for intrapreneurs vs. journalists?
