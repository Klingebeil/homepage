# Reading Recommendations
Some resources I‘ve used extensively in my own work.

## Books

[Creative Collaborations][1]—A book by the _Helsinki Design Lab_ on how to facilitate effective collaborations. It‘s small and helpful. (_free PDF_ or _Print on Demand_)

## Articles

[Strategy and stewardship][2]—A short summary with some additional thoughts about HDL‘s notion „Stewardship“ in the context of strategic work. In short: it‘s all about tight feedback loops.

[Narrative Strategy: Thoughts on an emerging indie consulting style][3]—I like the idea of using communication as a strategic tool for work inside complex organizations. Especially when it comes to trying to influence the deeper layers of organizational meaning, such as imaginaries, visions and intents.

[Experiments in Studio Telemetry][4]—Some interesting experiments around keeping and streamlining criticism and feedback in a studio environment.
