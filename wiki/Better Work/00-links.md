# Reading Recommendations
Some resources I‘ve used extensively in my own work.

## Books

[Legible Practices][1]—A collection of methods and case studies of work by the Helsinki Design Lab. Written to be used not to as marketing material. (_free PDF_ or _Print on Demand_)

[In Studio: Recipes for Systemic change][2]—A longer collection of the studio model for innovation the Helsinki Design Lab used. It focusses on diving deep into the problem and trying to understand the underlying trends rather then simply sprinting your way to a solution. (_free PDF_ or _Print on Demand_)

[Creative Collaborations][3]—Again a book by the Helsinki Design Lab on how to facilitate effective collaborations. It‘s small and helpful. (_free PDF_ or _Print on Demand_)

[Dark Matter and Trojan Horses: A Strategic Design Vocabulary][4]—Dan Hills long essay on strategic design. It‘s written for designers and architects, but is ultimately applicable to everyone finding themselves in the unfortunate position of trying to change an organization. Hill focusses on ways and means of designing the context of work. Published by _Strelka_ it‘s available on Amazon, as well as some eBook version on different platforms. You might have to look around a bit.

## Articles

[Strategy and stewardship][5]—A short summary with some additional thoughts about HDL‘s notion „Stewardship“ in the context of strategic work. In short: it‘s all about tight feedback loops.

[Narrative Strategy: Thoughts on an emerging indie consulting style][6]—I like the idea of using communication as a strategic tool for work inside complex organizations. Especially when it comes to trying to influence the deeper layers of organizational meaning, such as imaginaries, visions and intents.
