title: Using ChatGPT for research & writing

These are a couple of notes and prompts I collected while using *ChatGPT* in a research and writing project.

# Research

## Summaries
`Give me a summary`

`Give me a summary in [number] sentences`

This is pretty straightforward but *ChatGPT* is actually not bad at generating summaries. Copy in the text or paragraph and add one of the above and there you go.

So far I‘ve used this approach to generate a first drafts for executive summaries and short summaries for notes in my Obsidian Vault.

**Caution**{: .label .color-red} *GPT* will still make mistakes and most likely miss arguments you might find especially important. Always edit, never copy.

# Writing

## Eloquence

`Make me sound more eloquent`

This is for the lazy ones. *GPT* is actually pretty good at rephrasing paragraphs and sentences (or at least give you a second option). Prefect for some light copy-editing or gap-filling.

Copy your text, add the prompt and check the output. You can even drop in bullet-points and let the model fill out the gaps.

**Caution**{: .label .color-red} *GPT* may appear smart but isn‘t able to actually understand your writing. Edit accordingly and treat the model as you would everyone else‘s writing suggestions.

# Limits

## Structure

**Caution**{: .label .color-red} *GPT* won‘t save you from writing bad arguments or badly structured articles. Yes, you can generate whole articles through the interface but only if you want to arrive at the same SEO-mush as everyone else.
