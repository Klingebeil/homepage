These are a couple of notes and prompts I collected while using *GPT* in a research and writing project.

# Research

## Summaries

`Give me a summary`

`Give me a summary in [number] sentences`

This is pretty straightforward but *GPT* is actually not bad at generating summaries. Copy in the text or paragraph and add one of the above and there you go.

So far I‘ve used this approach to generate a first drafts for executive summaries and short summaries for notes in my Obsidian Vault.

**Caution**{: .label .color-red} *GPT* will still make mistakes and most likely miss arguments you might find especially important. Always edit, never copy.

# Writing

## Simplify

`Simplify this text`

`Explain this text to me as if I am [number] years old`

This works in similar fashion as a summary. With the added benefit of *GPT* attempting to break down more complex explanations. Again, simply paste the text and add one command at the end.

**Caution**{: .label .color-red} *GPT* may appear smart but isn‘t able to actually understand the writing. Edit accordingly and treat the model as you would everyone else‘s writing suggestions.

## Eloquence

`Make me sound more eloquent`

This is for the lazy ones. *GPT* is actually pretty good at rephrasing paragraphs and sentences (or at least give you a second option). Prefect for some light copy-editing or gap-filling.

Copy your text, add the prompt and check the output. You can even drop in bullet-points and let the model fill out the gaps.

**Caution**{: .label .color-red} *GPT* may appear smart but isn‘t able to actually understand your writing. Edit accordingly and treat the model as you would everyone else‘s writing suggestions.

## Further Questions

`What are some interesting questions to continue this disucssion?`

This one is more experimental. In short *GPT* will attempt to generate a number of question based on the provided text. Some might be helpful for helping you further flesh-out your arguments while some might turn out rather boring.

**Caution**{: .label .color-red} *GPT* tends to generate rather obvious questions and has a somewhat disturbing prevalence towards “how might wes…”. Consider yourself warned.

# Limits

Every technology has its limits. Here are some things I found with *GPT*.

## Sources

*GPT* is notoriously bad with sources. Ask for some and it will simply invent citations and references. **It‘s not a search or even knowledge engine.** Do not use it like one.

## Structure

**Caution**{: .label .color-red} *GPT* won‘t safe you from writing bad arguments or badly structured articles. Yes, you can generate whole articles through the interface but only if you want to arrive at the same SEO-mush as everyone else.
