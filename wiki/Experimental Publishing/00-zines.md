# What is a zine?

As publications, zines live in an interesting niche between low-key social media content and high-end glossy magazines. They’re often hand-made, printed and stapled pieces of paper, sold, traded or given away for free.

The name bears witness to this niche. „Zines“ is even derived from the word „magazine“, simply without the *maga-*.

I think the easiest way of understanding zines is to look at them as a practice, less as a medium or format. **Zines are a practice of a) self-expression and b) construction of a public[^1].**

Most analysis focusses on the self-expression of people through zines, since it’s the most visible part. Zines are often used by artists, writers, poets or illustrators as a place for experiments but also activists or organizers to share ideas, manifestos or a mixture of everything.

The reason zines have such a allure is because they’re *easy* to produce. There’s a magic [in bringing something physically into the world](https://www.zinemun.ch/p/soulellis) and sharing it with others that digital has a hard time catching.

> That’s one of the beautiful things about zines, the immediacy. The ability, with access to a laser printer, a Xerox machine, or a risograph, to print one sheet, fold it in half, and call it a thing, and be able to hand that to somebody in the most basic way.

This act of sharing of sending it to people — sometimes across the globe is the second part of the practice. The experience is richer, socially more engaged and — honestly — more fun than any social media platform could every be.

A zine is not a piece of content. At it’s best it can’t be reduced into the rigid spaces of a virtual feed. It’s alive, scrappy but alive.

[^1]:  I am choosing „public“ instead of „community“ for good reason here. Over the last years the idea of a community has been horribly misused and hollowed — just because a random group of people happen to use the same app or subscribe to the same instagram account doesn’t make them a community. Instead it’s more fitting to refer to them as a „public“ as i.e. defined by [Michael Warner](http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00335630209384388) and others.
