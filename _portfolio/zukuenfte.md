# Zukünfte
Though trends are often presented as a force of nature reorganizing society or the economy things are more complicated if you look more closely. In fact “trends” are often performative, meaning formulating and naming one ensure their influence in the first place. Especially if those trends are propagated by prominent consulting agencies such as Gartner, BCG or TKTKTK.

This of course doesn‘t mean that trends don‘t exist, but the framing and propagation is often directly influenced by the need for new investment vehicles. This is why there‘s an almost inexhaustible supply of “the next big thing” in the realm of technologies. Be that VR, AR, blockchain, artificial intelligence or… iPads.

As a result we observed a influx of FOMO (fear of missing our) in the questions managers asked us. People were anxious if we might experience a further disruption as a media industry if we missed a new development, failed to invest in a new startup or didn‘t implement the latest technology. What was needed was a internal counter-weight to reframe and structure those discussions while also reducing the fear of missing out on the latest hype.

In collaboration with the Berlin-based consulting agency _Third Wave_ we developed the quarterly magazine _Zukünfte_ (engl. “futures”). Focussed on new technologies we combined short explorations to each tech-trend with different small case-studies to create a magazine that would be useful to our managers but also our colleagues.

During the project I not only headed the editorial part of the project, but also designed and distributed the magazines. The texts were written by the core-team as well as collaborators throughout the organisation and freelancers.
