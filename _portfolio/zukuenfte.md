# Zukünfte
Trends are often presented as a monolithic force of nature, reorganizing society, or the economy. But things tend to be more complicated if you look more closely. In fact “trends” are often performative, meaning describing and naming one often ensures their influence in the first place. Especially if those trends are propagated by prominent consulting agencies such as Gartner, BCG, or FTI.

This doesn‘t mean that trends don‘t exist, but their framing is often influenced by the need for new investment vehicles.  Trends are often built, not discovered—especially in the tech industry.  There‘s been an almost inexhaustible supply of “the next big thing” in the last decade. Be that VR, AR, blockchain, artificial intelligence, or… iPads.

As a result, we observed an influx of FOMO (fear of missing out) in the questions managers asked us. People were anxious about another disruption of the media industry if we missed a new development, failed to invest in a new startup, or didn‘t use the latest technology. What was needed was an internal counter-weight to structure and reframe those discussions.

In collaboration with the Berlin-based consulting agency _Third Wave_, we developed the quarterly magazine _Zukünfte_ (Engl. “futures”). Focussed on new technologies we combined short explorations of each trend with different case-studies to create a magazine that would be useful not only to our managers but also to our colleagues.

During the project, I headed the editorial, research, and design parts of the project. The texts were written by the core team as well as collaborators throughout the organization and freelancers.
